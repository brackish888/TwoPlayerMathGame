Class: Players(Names, Lives)
This class will keep track of the Player objects and their lives with instance variables.

Each player begins with their name and three lives.

Player objects should be initialized with their names and their lives will be incremented with getter and setter attributes.

After asking each question we check to see if true or falsey
This means that those attributes will need a subtraction method for when a player loses a life by getting an answer wrong(falsey)

If players lives is more than one then game method called.


Class User interaction(print messages, user_input return to the Caller)

will output a message saying if answered correct or not


Class Game(current_player, game_status)

This class will keep track of whose turn it is.

Has method for checking both players lives after each turn to see if there is a winner

This will then call the player class method to subtract from the players lives if falsey
{% comment %} If a winner is identified then the lives are reset. {% endcomment %}

calls the questions method if the game continues

initializes with 
current_player = player_1
question = set by method
answer = set by method


Class Questions(generate_question, check if truthy/falsey)

Randomly generates a question for each turn,

Calls a check answer method with the gets chomp variable,

{% comment %} Has a method that checks if the answer given is true or not {% endcomment %}
